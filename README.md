OVERVIEW:
This project is an end-to-end data analytics and decision-support system developed in Python for retail businesses. It integrates customer, product, and sales datasets to deliver actionable insights, including customer segmentation, sales trend analysis, campaign targeting, and predictive forecasting.

By combining data preprocessing, analytics, visualization, and machine learning, the system demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into business intelligence that drives customer engagement and revenue growth.

KEY FEATURES:
Customer Segmentation (RFM Profiling);
Classifies customers into High-Value, Frequent Buyers, Dormant, and New/Regular groups based on recency, frequency, and monetary metrics.
Sales Performance Insights;
Identifies top-performing products and quantifies revenue contributions.
Data Visualizations & Dashboards
Generates intuitive visualizations for:
Top 10 revenue-generating products
Monthly sales performance trends
Customer segment distribution
Targeted Campaign Simulation;
Mimics personalized marketing campaigns for different customer groups and tracks engagement metrics (open rate, click rate).
Predictive Forecasting;
Uses a linear regression model to forecast next monthâ€™s expected sales, enabling proactive business planning.
Automated Reporting;
Exports segmentation reports, campaign results, and visualization outputs for further use in decision-making.
